<P> Our second single came out in August 1996 and was put out by our friends in <a href="http://www.prairienet.org/braid/">Braid </a>with their label Grand Theft Autumn. It's a split single with the band Supporting Actress, who put the song "I'm Attracted to..." on their side. Our side has the song "Backlash," and I don't know who did the artwork for our side, but the girl looks <B>so</B> sad...</p>

<P> Our third single came out in May 1997, on <a href="http://www.parasolrecords.com/mudrecs/sarge.asp">Mud Records</a>. The A side is one of our new songs "Stall" and the B side is a cover of the Cyndi Lauper tune "Time After Time." We recorded these songs with Matt Talbott, who's in Hum and who built a cool recording studio in the basement of his home. My friend Mike Herbert did the design and illustrations, which are actaully purple and green, but the file I have on my server is different...</p>
