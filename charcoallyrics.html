As usual we're drunkyou've a circle two girls deep I steal yr cigarette you grab my wrist ready to teach You kiss me with affection and turn me on again At times we're so alike that I try hard not to condemn And you are so wrong I can't think what to say I won't compete with all these boys I've watched you too long my hands are trapped and caught up in your ways and you destroy So go away I know you're angry with a few too many beers but I'm so sick of your good looks the way you exploit your fears I'm inhaling deep still knowing what you lack This smoke is tied to you and I tried hard but I broke the pact And you are so wrong I can't think what you say I understand more than you think I've been here too long This was bound to happen and you lean my ways as my ears ring And you are so dumb you don't see how I stareI fake a smile and brush on by When this is done I'll know too much but I don't even care about your lies And you are to wrong I can't think what to say I won't compete with all these boys I've watched you too long my lips are burning caught up in your ways and you destroy

And this is making me miserable I know what you see in her But I don't know what I see in you yr not so cool I guess this is what I deserve You catch me watching you I start to blush and my cheeks are burning hot My eyes drop to the ground I try to read your glance to decide what you are and who yr not Cause this backlash changes everything so understand this isn't me It's been a long time coming now waiting for this shower to wash me clean I know you think I'm just a kid and I may be but things aren't the way I thought they'd be And this has caught me by surprise and all of this seems wrong And though I think you like the way I woke you up these things don't seem to take too long Cause this backlash changes everything so understand this isn't me It's been a long time coming now I'm waiting for this vodka to wash him free I know he thinks I'm just a kid and I may be but I think I've let too much be seen
I've watched you too long my lips are burning caught up in your ways and you destroy

Dear  Josie when you get this note I will be gone from here I'm sorry for all the things I let you put me through And though I loved you dear I think it's time I made it clear that this will be the last time that I ever think of you We met and from the first I knew that you'd be the one I didn't see the damage that you'd do Once we moved in this place things got better I got my first real taste of you And for you I played along I suppressed it all but I think it's time I let it out So I'm writing you this letter cause I think I deserve better I'll pack my bags and go and figure out what life's about It's time I got out You hated all my friends made me get rid of them I lost my nerve I stupidly complied You said you were the best I'd ever had but Josie dear you fuck you simply lied Dear Josie you haven't been true Dear Josie I'm no longer in love with you Everything I say you misconstrue Josie we're through You were the first boy I fell in love with I admit I played out of my league But to tell you the truth I finally had it You'll no longer make me bleed We're done and I'm not coming back I'm on the run cause what I need you lack You've used me and abused me but in time I'll pass you by Josie I'm breaking these ties This I've watched you too long my lips are burning caught up in your ways and you destroy

I walked into the bar where tou hung out 24 and I still hadn't figured it out 8 months pregnant and sick with all these lies Smeared red lipstick and your hand halfway up her thigh I guess I learned from the sight of you with her And now this child will come into the death of me and you to wait her turn This headstrong child turned wild at 13 Fallen angel fragile shell and blue blood to bleed She's finding nothing in the answers that she sought And no redemption in his car in a vacant lot And her eyes burned Caused by the anger that can be learned And it made her sick to see the void of us and she waits her turn She's 20 now and stripped apart on the inside Her eyes are empty and laughs with a cold pride But a match to the arm gets her by She paid attention took the legacy and made it her prize And she has learned Cause you gave this gift to her Now she has watched and suffered through the still of me and you to take her turn

I'm going to smash you crash you slash you to the bone This kingdom over which you rule is about to be overthrown As you gasp for breath and I tighten my choking This bitter taste coasting your tongue is the once sweet taste of me I'll be the black widow creeping up your back I'll wait til you fall fast asleep and it's then I will attack I know you like to brag about the way that you're well hung but it won't do you any good once you've been stung Cause I'm gonna crush you I'm gonna be the hottest siren in town Lure you into my waters then watch you drown You'll dive deep cause you think yr strong but honey you are going down cause what you did was wrong I'm gonna light a couple matches for you Strike fast and hard and watch you burn in a way that you never knew This backdraft has been set cause it's time that you learned The table have been turned so burn baby burn And I'm gonna crush you You thought that you would get away but now the time has come You played and played and played and now there's nowhere left to run One thing you should know for sure I will have my day Oh dear god how you'll pay I saved all my money and I bought this brand new axe and I'll coldly watch your eyes in pain as I neatly hack your appendages off one by one and I'll peel you skin off bit by bit cause I'm not quite done This pistol is cold steel and it's shiny killer black And darling you were the prick that broke this nice girl's back Yr gonna suck its barrel down I can't wait to see you quiver Hole through your head like in my heart when I pull the trigger And I'm gonna crush you

You stumble down the stairs and hesitate at my door I open up and find you there making it harder for me to ignore And we need to sleep as a respite from all these fears I see the danger in what's been said and I'm wondering how I'll fare

Girls will be girls they say but hey we sleep together whenever I choose You have no charm no way but hey if you stick around boy yr bound to get used And you think that I care well I don't Boys will be boys I know and so you're weak and pretty fucking blind You've paid my price kneeled low and though I'm gone you'll learn you don't need my kind And you think that I care well I don't And you try I don't know why Cause if things don't go my way I usually lie And you try but God knows why Cause if I don't get my way I show some thigh For you I don't feel a thing but shame Leave me alone you've got to learn that I'll walk away If you see things clear you'll place the blame on me cause I'm all heat and vain In vain And you think I care well I don't

I curse the spring that stole my breath and just a year ago I nearly burned to death I try to clear my mind I try to ignore all the ways that this reminds me of the last time A handfull of pills or so is all that it takes I know If you pour me a glass of rum I'll crush this cigarette out before I'm done Bright lights choke me And who are you to make me bleed I'm fragmenting apart I hate the way that you stare through me I came to and caught my breath charcoal on my lips the only memory left I'm falling down from screams raging through my mind Just promise me this'll be the last time

I couldn't understand that you did what you could looking back I know that if I could go back I would despite the screams at home you were the very last boy I have known to deserve his throne Just 13 and being loud was a way to defeat the time when I 'd have to make that final retreat Stared at the bruises when I was alone Stole the car flew down those backroads to your home The sea of rum that you gave I couldn't come You couldn't save me from myself and I drowned blind drunk from a lack of restraint I didn't tell Your anger showed you understood just 13 and their hands on me every day I fought and these arm show the price that I paid He got me stoned you made me stop but when you had to leave you didn't give it a thought But time is giving me a grasp on the ground that you stood
