<p>bits and pieces about rachel!<BR><BR>
i have an older brother andy who's married to a very cool chick named ruby and they have a great daughter, my baby niece eve, whom i babysit when i'm not on tour!<BR><BR>
i started playing bass in junior high school cuz sting played standup bass in the "every breath you take" video. so i played standup classical bass from junior high all through college, and i bought an electric bass in high school. I have three basses- my old ibanez blazer from high school that i just retired this year, my black G&L bass that i bought from rose from the posterkids this summer, and i have a junky no-name bass courtesy of my friend jim. I played out of a beloved 60 watt traynor for years, but in sarge i've been playing a fender bassman and recently i upgraded to an eden half-stack with a 400 watt head! enuf gear talk...<BR><BR>
i just finished my master's degree in industrial design. i also have an undergraduate degree in industrial design. my thesis for my master's was to develop a prototype of children's reading software. i'm very much interested in interface principles and navigation through three-dimensional virtual space. i also taught two computer classes all through college. before coming to graduate school, i lived and worked in both new york city and chicago.<BR><BR>
last but not least,  i collect nancy sinatra albums, mr. potatoheads and nurse novel books!
