<P> The ooh do i love you comp came out in the spring of 1996 and all proceeds went to benefit the women's shelter in champaign. forty bands put a song on this comp and all the songs had to include the word love. sorry the image looks like crap, but we will replace it shortly.</p>

<P>our friend at dark beloved cloud asked us to contribute to his comp, dreams are free (with purchase). it had to be a song that we hadn't released yet, so we put "the girl's bad news" from the charcoal recording sessions on this disk.</p>
