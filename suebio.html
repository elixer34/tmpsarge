<FONT SIZE=2><P>Sue Roth of Sarge</P>
<P>Rocker/Temp, 25</P>

<P>Born and raised in Maryland, Sue moved to Chicago to pursue rock and roll in the summer of 1997.  Before Chicago, she was living in a suburb of Philadelphia, Conshohocken, and had been working in marketing and publicity for several professional theaters in Philadelphia.  And before that she was attending Villanova University where she studied Communications and Theater.  Sue joined Sarge a year after she moved to Chicago. Previous bands that she was in that you've never, ever heard of were the Maryjanes, Julie Trend, The Period Three and Roadkill.  Incidentally, you will <U>never</U> want to hear these bands.</P>

<P>Besides rocking, Sue can be found temping to pay the bills or at The Empty Bottle (her favorite Chicago bar/club) where she spends all of her money that should be going towards bills.  Her favorite color is orange, favorite food is pizza, favorite beer is Guinness.  Sue is also the proud new owner of a 1966 Fender Jazzmaster, "Chief," which will proudly go on tour with her 1970 Fender Telecaster Deluxe, "Liam." Sue loves Fenders as much as she loves living in the scene in Chicago.  Her favorite Chicago bands of late are: L'Altra, Ghosts and Vodka, We Ragazzi, Heroic Doses, Sweep the Leg Johnny, Del Rey, The 90 Day Men and (of course) Lustre King.  </P></FONT></BODY>
