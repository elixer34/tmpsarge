6 months at bay and we wrecked the porch then kissed at dark we crossed the line where it was blurred not sure it's smart cause I'm not the angel that he wishes I could be for all my storms all words escape me every time he looks at me and I hated the way we talked as if there was nothing really important to say 'til I noticed how he stuck around every time I wished he would stay anticipation killed me nightly and he slept soundly while I laid awake 'til it was more than I could take 6 spun the bottle but I was too afraid to try I've been with lots of boys and they screwed me up so I learned to lie but he plays me records gets me home safe late at night he kissed me one too many times but still this boy he couldn't see the light I think this could turn out fine if I'd shut up and let things be ok but I fought back while we laid in his bed and I worry about the line between his and mine and what the boys will say when I finally gave him up and walked away he started following and this is harder than I ever thought it'd be so tell me will I pay for the smack that left me safe so let's stay in bed all day and pray things will die ok

They left with clothes in disarray and her on the bed 15 that day they got her drunk they never apologized she kept her mouth shut the way girls should tried to decide just where she stood and I was the only one to see the glowing anger in her eyes still wonder what went through her mind think she was sick to death of trying to keep quiet and she bought a box of matches cause this flame was growing brighter every night and she took this as a sign that life was gonna be like this they get their way you watch it she's not the first and she's probably not the last then three more girls talked killed any doubt that she had any choice about a little light inside that told her it was time to take revenge and it was almost time when the first spark flew I'd like to think she smiled and she carried that torch cause the stale smell of

And I tried to pin you down at 3am by 5 looks like you've won me over again I've spent the last year watching you deteriorate you're a likable bully all along it's been my mistake cause all these nuanced conversations that cried for quiet consolations were affectations of affection that stemmed from suggestive rejections and still I loved your lilting anger dissected every word you sang there now I know every loaded line I've heard them all too many times but I don't believe you anymore this insincerity is starting to bore me and I can't figure out what's wrong with you when these indiscretions start anew and I'm torn I thought I'd gotten through to you but then next day looked like you'd one-upped me again your machinations leave me speechless and resigned and while I won't deny your talent I'm gonna quit wasting my time note all these ripped-off observations encasing sly retaliations they're declarations of defection from your beguiling new deceptions but I still love the way you eye me you gauge my temper satisfy me and you're so quick to realign but I've heard that song too many times so why'd you have to change? or have you always been this way? I miss the way you were before you figured out that I'm not yours and at every show I'm just another face in your front row but now I know you're so alone so why'd you have to change? do you ever miss me the same way? I miss our long talks on the porch with shifting eyes and sweet retorts and it's been so long I can't remember what went wrong I miss you but I'm giving up

So glad when you drove down for the night hadn't seen the two of you in a while thought I could set your heads right wish you'd believe me he's not all he seems to be his eyes burn hot enough but hold less warmth than you think I don't know what the story was but I want more for both of us his eyes see everything he's got you pinned I know it all too well because I've been there before with him he couldn't even look you in the eye that should have been your first clue you were just another girl for that night another glass of wine will keep my mouth shut as you plan you're so sure a few more words will make him understand as he echoes through the halls you hear your name in every word he offers up to ease the shame and he checks for signs of weakness as you second guess the meaning of these games he preys by solitary glances begs for secondary chances charms and feigns can't you see he's never gonna change

Fine you've shut me out the door is barred that's alright I know exactly where you are but the keys are gone and I'm scared to death you'll take this threat too far so what was going through your head that day you hit her deadline and lacked the words that could explain when I saw it in her face I went straight to you and kept watch through pouring rain she always swore she'd have her way and you paid the price it's true and turned on me but I never betrayed fist after fist I stuck around silent I watched you hit the ground everyday I drove from your hotel to my high school I talked less and less made sure none of my friends knew so when you said it was my fault I had to believe you fight cause too much blood has stained my hands please hold on tight I know exactly where you stand but save your breath cause what you breathe will you kill you faster than I can so if you go just remember you'll be taking away all that I know you make your choice but I'll be lying here with my face pressed to the ground praying to hear your voice and you said that I should come along let's fall into the earth together we could finally escape we could be gone

<B>Half As Far</B><BR>
Sometimes seems like you're my only friend a month apart then back again and we're losing speed now we've talked this through a thousand times I fall apart and still you try but we're losing heat to all the little things that smoulder in the spring you're only half as far as I need to go for another endless drive I stare straight ahead and wonder why this feeling grows with every day I'm far from home last night I listened to you breathe I like to watch you when you sleep and there's a storm outside but there's a comfort in your voice it brings me silence through the noise that fills my mind with now I take the phone to bed at night to catch your calls and pick my fights I'm not being fair see I don't want to waste your time and it's not that you're a waste of mine but I'm getting scared of

<B>I Took You Driving</B><BR>
It was late august when I met you just in town for the night but nonetheless I pinned you in the hallway and you slipped your hand underneath my dress so last night I took you driving I checked you out from the corner of my eye you're so slick I'm growing wary but sometimes you're so sweet I can't decide and I tell myself give it a little time you gotta keep this boy in line you been down this road before and know what it can bring you haven't seen him in a year and you've got to be aware chances are he's only looking for one thing but there's just something about him keeps my mind on him for days really I could do without him but I think I'll play his game and wait and I like the way he looks me up and down I like the sneer that curls it's way around his mouth and he asked me why I'm always such a bitch he leaned to kiss me but I pulled away cause I'm not so sure this boy is it and I'm just so sick of boys in bands with all these egos out of hand I'm sure as hell not gonna sit around and wait if he wants some girl to understand him admiration on demand I think it's time he starts looking some other place so last night I took you driving I shut you down with a smirk and faked a sigh I still think you're kinda sleazy but why don't you call when you're in town next time

<B>Fast Girls</B><BR>
I met this girl at a Madison punk rock show she made fun of all the boys from my hometown to tell the truth she made me laugh she had their weaknesses down pat her little digs made me smile when I hadn't in a while and she said she likes the fast songs best now I think I like her too she's a helluva girl but I'm leaving town so soon and I didn't have the courage then but I thought of her the whole way home when I shoulda been thinking of you heard she's the kind of girl who gets around she doesn't care what people say she's gonna live her life her way and she's awfully blunt with no tact you gotta like a girl like that now I feel the same everytime I think she's gotta a beautiful name and I think she's just my thing and the look in her eyes it was the angle of her smile and I thought of the girls that I've known and they seemed so long ago now I know that I like the fast songs best and I think she likes me too I like the fast girls best they do whatever they wanna do and I couldn't find the words just then

<B>The First Morning</B><BR>
Winter's back and the time to part's at hand you start to pack we make awkward plans but there's not much to say I'll see you in 30 days I hold your cat cause that's the closest thing I have to you looks like he's gonna be leaving me too and the first morning seemed so long now it's 16 days you've been gone we chase from coast to coast with transatlantic calls to mute the panic and try for calm when every night seemed like the last we savored every breath clung tight to fend off future and past a year has gone so fast a part of me wondered if you'd figure it out a different strength to my gaze or sweeter taste to my mouth from the look in your eyes I'd say you picked it up just fine I shut my eyes but I can't get you outta my mind think I really fucked up this time and this year's gone so fast now everytime you touch my cheek I die if I could take it back I would I'd try sure I could get right this time and you can scream on but if you slam the door once more I'm gone so why should we keep on pretending everything's fine nothing's wrong tried to tell you gently I can feel us ending no more desperate phone calls I think we've hit our wall

<B>To Keep You Trained</B><BR>
I see you out and it's hard not to turn in shame I lit your face and rubbed my fingers through the flame the sky crashed down thought I warned you well but if you paid attention I can't tell you bleached me out now I find peace in the ground you gained and I can feel my chest collapsing and today I couldn't stand the sound of laughing I may be cruel but you had too much at stake you need to learn when to leave what not to take I still feel sick for killing the way we talked a stolen kiss had repercussions that I never saw I told of torture to keep you trained with all the glass intact I glittered sane still blisters fade or break and you're every mistake I ever made
