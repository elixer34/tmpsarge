Sarge's Charcoal clears the air<br>

The songs on Charcoal (Mud), the ferocious debut from the Champaign (Illinois) trio Sarge, all seem to hinge on the moment when people wake up to the situation they're in and decide to speak plainly about what's going on around them and what's happening in their hears.  The lyrics, by guitarist and singer Elizabeth Elmore, are compact and direct, fresh even when they're bitter.  The songs -- and the way Elmore, bassist Rachel Switzky, and drummer Russ Horvath play them -- combine the exhilarating freedom of people finding their voices with the piercing clarity that comes when they realize what it is they want to say.  The plain speech of these songs ("I think it's time I make it clear that this will be the last time that I ever think of you") seems almost to surprise Elmore's characters, as if, having said their piece, they stepped back and thought, "My God, is that what I've been feeling?"

<br><br>

Elmore writes with too much experience for the songs to be about a loss of innocence.  What gives them their weight is the realization in her voice that she's not too young to be dealing with breakups, unfaithful lovers, anger that can poison memories of pleasure.  "I know you think I'm just a kid/And I may be/But things aren't the way I thought they'd be," she sings on "Backlash," scarcely acknowledging that unfairness.  When, as the song closes, she adds, "I think I've let too much be seen," it's almost a point of pride.  There's as much determination to suck up the pain and get on with things as there is reluctance to open herself to being hurt again.

<br><br>

On "Chicago," Elmore sings, "I walked into the bar where you hung out/24 and I still hadn't figured it out/Eight months pregnant and sick with all these lies/Smeared red lipstick and your hand halfway up her thigh."  The regret and disgust and pain she gets into those lines bleed into one another.  A momentary surrender to heartbreak in the high voice she uses for "sick with all these lies" is immediately discarded, as if she suddenly realized it's not going to be of much use to her.  Even before she's begun those line, the music has been whipped into a maelstrom.  The song accelerates, going from one harsh awakening to another, pushed ahead by the crack of  drums.  With all avenues of retreat sealing shut behind her, Elmore rushes head-first into the center of the chaos: "And now this child will come into the death of me and you."  Then, after an unbearably tense pause, she offers a curse: "to wait her turn."  She sings those words damning her own naivete, and what she knows will be her inability to prevent her child from making the same mistakes.

<br><br>

At first, Sarge appear to be playing off the obvious tension between the harshness of their sound and Elmore's sweet, girlish voice.  Keep listening and you'll hear that sound in the vocals.  It's present (in "Smoke") in the melodiousness with which Elmore delivers the line " And you are so [pause] dumb," making the last word a cold slap in the face.  The drama in these songs is internal; the band's sound gives it shape and urgency.  Switzky's bass playing is inventive throughout, ominous and fleet, sometimes used to sketch out a melody or to enter into a dialogue with Elmore's guitar.  She creates a briny, sensuous undertow for the rage and freedom in Elmore's playing.  The simply strummed bass line that precedes the clash of guitar in "Bedroom" tells you everything about the uneasy lover's truce the lyrics sketch out. The giddy guitar rush that follows the line "It's time I got out" in "Dear Josie, Love Robyn" (a Dear John tossed off like a gleeful fuck-you) is the sound of someone impatient to get on with life.  These songs are dark but not hopeless.  Sarge's sound is a determination to translate private defeats into shared triumphs.  On Charcoal, the truth doesn't set you free, but it sure as hell clears the air.

<br><br>

Charcoal was released in the fall and promptly fell through the cracks, thought it's easily the most impressive debut of 1996.  At the Middle East recently, with new drummer Chad Romanski (Horvath has left to teach high school), Sarge were unassuming and extraordinary.  Switzky played with visible delight, shaking her long wavy hair like a cocker spaniel's ears till it obscured her face.  And Elmore displayed the mixture of self-critical reticence and helpless candor that characterizes her lyrics.  Keeping well behind the mike and regarding the crowd a tad warily, she unleashed one number after another, and they all leapt out at you.  I left convinced that the band love what they do and have have no idea how good they are.

Issue #10<br><BR>

My friend and I were arguing a few weeks ago over whether Bikini Kill or Team Dresch would be the band that would be the most historically important ten years from now.  He said Bikini Kill because they will be the ones who inspired so many girls to start their own bands.  I said Team Dresch because they will be the ones who inspired the good bands.  Sarge's first album is an initial point of evidence for my side.  It's clearly the product of a boy-crazy girl listening to Personal Best about a million times.  It's also funny and angry and tuneful and fast and instrumentally awesome and so on-the-mark it makes me smile every time.  And they're only going to get better- the aforementioned girl is 20 years old.  Yay.  <B>- clarissa</B>

December 1996<BR><BR>

Woman speak the harsh, desperate language of Denis Johnson's "Jesus' Son" in the songs of this Illinois punk trio ("I walked into the bar where you hung out/24 and I still hadn't figured it our/Eight months pregnant and sick with all these lies") but there's a will to speak a more commonplace language in Elizabeth Elmore's singing and guitar playing.  There's as much old Van Halen in her sound as Gang of Four.<B>- Greil Marcus </B>

July 1997<br><br>

Champaign-Urbana trio Sarge creates a distinct pop sound based on the jarring contrast between lead vocalist/guitarist Elizabeth Elmore's sweet, fragile voice and the unbridled anger of the lyrics.  At times, Elmore even adds a theatrical flair to her vocals, making her observations on dead-end relationships all the more compelling.  Together with bass player Rachel Switzky and drummer Russ Horvath, she fuses elements of folk music with punk intensity on this impressive debut.

<br><br>

Elmore depicts a cycle of self-destruction on the hard-rocking "Chicago," from the pregnant woman who discovers her husband cheating on her in a bar to their daughter, who's running wild by the age of 13: "She's finding nothing in the answers that she sought/And no redemption in his car in a vacant lot."  "Dear Josie, Love Robyn" offers a farewell letter to an abusive live-in boyfriend.  Elmore's vocals evoke a Broadway musical before the band kicks into a high energy declaration of independence.

<br><br>

"Smoke" takes a jaded look at the bar scene and "Crush" serves as the ultimate revenge song with its comic images of intense violence.  Charcoal has quieter songs about relationships too, like "Bedroom" and "Another Gear Uncaught," but they're not any more optimistic.  Luckily, Sarge keeps things interesting with engaging performances and a strong sense of melody. <B>- Terrence Flamm</B>

Well, here's the second project to emerge from the ever-fabulous Corndolly.  Sarge is a new trio with Rachel (the Corndolly), plus Elizabeth and Chad (who replaced Russ).  I was expecting something more on the punkier side, and there is a trace of punk, but Sarge plays upbeat ditties that will drive you into a frenzy of pop bliss.  Picking out a favorite track is almost impossible; all the tracks are great; but I guess the scales tilt a tad bit over on "Backlash", "Crush", and "The Last Boy".  In total, Sarge delivers nine tracks of pure fun.

Did you ever hear a song one minute and have to buy the album next?  That's how it was for Sarge's debut, Charcoal.  The song "Dear Josie, Love Robyn" completely blew me away .  In just over three minutes, it entered my head, refusing to leave, demanding to be played over again and again.  Sarge covers ground similar to Red Five (though not as intense) and Ani Difranco (though not as deeply personal).  If you're looking for female "pop punk" (as it's been called) pick up Sarge.  This is an order. <B>- Brian Brehmer</B>

With all the sped-up perkiness of the Fastbacks and all the careless tralala of Heavenly, the three upstanding Illinoisans comprising Sarge careen up and make a pretty, purgative noise.  Vocalist/main songwriter Elizabeth Elmore, solo or harmonizing with herself, sings songs about ugly breakups, dysfunctional families, bloodthirsty retribution, and worse- making it all sound nice as pie while guitar, bass, and drums  jangle plenty behind her.  The incongruity of the lyrics in their shiny punk-pop settings isn't always as strong as in "Crush": " I saved all my money and I bought this brand new axe and I'll coldly watch your eyes in pain as I neatly hack you appendages off one by one..." (she make it rhyme, too!), but it's always there.

<br><br>

The suspicion that Sarge's pert nonchalance operated as cheap irony, or that it signifies some deficit of emotion, gets allayed in the stark, slower "Another Gear Uncaught," a chilling before-and-after account of a suicide attempt conveyed through  a monologue addressed to an unseen person, or maybe to the narrator's alter ego.

<br><br>

Songs about suicide are bound to be too maudlin to bear, but Elmore flirts, threatens, rages, and despairs in such subtle turns that the song survives to haunt the listener.  Buoyed at first by a belle indifference, Elmore innocently bargains:" A handful of pills or so is all it takes, I know/And if you pour me a glass of rum, I'll crush this cigarette our before I'm done."  After her attempt is thwarted, in helpless frustration, she's done bargaining:" Just promise me this'll be the last time."  When the cold meaning sinks in, the prettiness fades; but Sarge love to tease with these two sides to their music, and, lucky you, you don't have to choose. <B>- Sara Manaugh</B>

Sarge w/Seely + Poem Rocket<br>
Brownies, Thursday January 16<br>

<br>

Three very different mixed-gender pop bands appear on this bill.  Atlanta's Seely recorded its jangle-and-drone debut, Parentha See, early last year; when it became the first American band on the British label Too Pure, the group recorded its debut with Tortoise's John McEntire, retitled it Julie Only, added a few new songs and rereleased it on its new imprint.  At times, particularly live, Seely seems to have picked up an awful  lot from Versus's slower numbers, but the girl-boy harmonies are awfully nice.  Poem Rocket could have been a hugely influential early '80s British guitar band, except that it was formed in New York a couple of years ago.  Its songs are often very long, but these guys know their way around a box of effects pedals, and the high volume of  a live show is the right way to hear them.

<br><br>

But come early for opening band Sarge, which is making its first New York appearance.  The Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, trio's Charcoal(Mud) was one of last year's most arresting debuts, a half-hour girl-punk pop wonder that synthesized the best of Team Dresch and Talulah Gosh with a dash of the Smiths.  Twenty year-old singer-guitarist Elizabeth Elmore writes playful, tricky, graceful songs of frustrated lust and postteen bitterness, and the band (including bassist Rachel Switzky, a veteran of the little-known gem Corndolly)plays them at rocket velocity, digging in hard and deep.  Elmore's voice is light and pretty, but there's a rage and sadness in her words that you'll hear if you pay attention as the lyrics fly past.  Catch Sarge now, hum the songs on your way home and brag to your friends later.  <B>- Douglas Wolk</B>

Sarge's Elizabeth Elmore wanted to be in a band so badly, she would leave clubs in her college town of Champaign, Illinois, sobbing.  "I didn't think I could play guitar well enough," she admits.  "I didn't know if anybody would like the songs I wrote."  Yet none of that insecurity surfaces in Elmore's songs, which speak so honestly and directly it's hard to believe she could be afraid of anything.

<br><br>Seething with passion, frustration, bitterness and vulnerability, the songs on Charcoal(Mud Records) might have stayed in Elmore's notebook forever if Rachel Switzky hadn't returned to Champaign for her master's degree, started playing bass with Elmore and handed their tape to her next door neighbor, Parasol Records' Geoff Merritt.

<br><br>

"Now my life is pretty good," says Elmore.  "I'm doing everything I ever wanted to do.  What's left to write about? I tried to write this really nice song about my boyfriend, all la-la-la and 'I'm in love.' it turned out mean.  It just doesn't suit me to write happy songs."
